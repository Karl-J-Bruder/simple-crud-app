Time provided: about 48-72 hours (if they ask for CSS, maybe more)

You're going to fetch data from this REST API:

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

Your front-end must allow the following actions:

* List all the posts ( https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts )
* Create a post
* Update a post
* Delete a post

This assignment involves multiple front-end concepts, among which:
* API call (I'll recommend you use Fetch API (don't need to install a library).
    You can use Axios, but I recommend you use Fetch.)
* Routing: Routing is optional in this exercise as everything can be done in a single page
* State management: pure React, not Redux
* Styling: CSS is not the main focus of the exercise so you don't need to spend time styling
* You're not allowed to use a React form library (Formik, etc.)

Such development aims at being the MVP of a growing application: scalability is an appreciated point

**Hint:

*The hardest part of the challenge is to edit a post. You might need to use 
    a spread operator in order to be able to edit an array of objects

*I suggest you use useState, and not useReducer. Keep things simple.

* Don't forget to use try/catch when fetching data

* Always check if the component is mounted before you set the state
